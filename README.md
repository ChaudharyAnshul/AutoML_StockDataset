# AutoMl StockDataset

This repository showcases the utilization of an AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) library to create and evaluate machine learning models. The primary goal is to demonstrate the ease of model creation and the effectiveness of AutoML in handling various datasets. In this project, we have trained and analyzed three distinct models using the AutoML library.

## AutoML Library

We have used the [AutoML library](https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/automl.html) for this project, which simplifies the process of model creation and optimization. This library automates several aspects of the machine learning pipeline, including:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning
- Model training and evaluation
- Model interpretation and analysis

## Dataset

For this demonstration, we have used a publicly available dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/nifty50-stock-market-data).

## Analysis

We have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the three models trained by the AutoML library. The analysis includes the following aspects:

1. **Model Performance**: We evaluate the performance of each model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.

2. **Model Interpretability**: We use interpretability techniques to gain insights into how each model makes predictions. This includes feature importance analysis and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values.

3. **Model Comparison**: We compare the three models to determine which one performs best on our dataset. This involves a detailed examination of their strengths and weaknesses.
